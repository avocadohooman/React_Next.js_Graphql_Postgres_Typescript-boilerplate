# React-Next.js-GraphQL-Postgres-Typescript Fullstack Project
In this fullstack project, I used various latest technologies to serve as boilerplate for future projects. 

It is a fake reddit platform, in which you can create, edit and delete posts. You can up-/down vote posts from other users and your own. Additionally, you can create an account and login. 


## Tech Stack
- React
- TypeScript
- GraphQL
- Apollo
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- TypeORM
- Redis

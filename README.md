# React-Next.js-GraphQL-Postgres-Typescript Fullstack Project
In this fullstack project, I used various latest technologies to serve as boilerplate for future projects.

My main focus was to take a deep dive into GraphQL and get familiar with server-side rendering, using the Next.js framework.

It is a fake reddit platform, in which you can create, edit and delete posts. You can up-/down vote posts from other users and your own. Additionally, you can create an account and login. 

It uses extensive caching thanks to GraphQL and also pagination.
